How to Play the Game
- In this Snake game, the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows longer and glides faster. The goal is to make the snake as long as possible to gain more points. The game ends when the snake bites itself.

Gameplay
- To avoid biting itself, make the most of the free spaces on the board.
